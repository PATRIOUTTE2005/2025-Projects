       <p id="section 1">Have you ever known what it feels like to be impartial to someone who promised you the world? Well look no further. The Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) promises this, vows that, does this, does that, and never commits to reform.
        <br> <br>

  <p id="section 2">
    The Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) seems to be owning up to itself amidst all the flood control project funds corruption reports. From temporarily disabling bidding, implementing fact-finding teams, up to laying cases against nefarious contractors and officials — it seems like the agency is indeed all hands on deck in cleaning up itself and deconstructing its projects that have been long criticized ever since.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p id="section 3">
      Despite the public being happy for the Department carrying out actions to combat the embezzlement issue within these project funds, these aren't enough to generate a long-term solution for the underlying and deeper problems within the agency. These steps, no matter how hectic they are being executed, only seem like temporary band-aids for optics and shutting people demanding accountability calm, because it only targets the dead leaves, not the root.

        Bidding Suspension Is Not Bidding Breaches Goodbye
  </p>
  <br>
  <p id="section 4">
    The DPWH has suspended biddings for locally funded infrastructure projects to reassess the process and remove the holes in the system. However, how will these ever change the actual illegal distribution of contracts? If there is no amelioration in the system of choosing and monitoring contractors, wrong contractors and ghost projects will only keep getting through long after the suspension.



      Mere Firings Will Be Firing Back
  </p>
  <br>
  <p id="section 5">
    The DPWH has also ordered the high officials of the agency to submit courtesy resignations in order to fulfill their vows to help in cleansing the department. However, it will not matter if they will be altered with individuals with more competence and decency. The officials who will not be changed will keep operating on the same behavior of perversiveness and negligence. So if the organizational culture of the agency is not rectified, the system of impunity and lack of accountability will only keep looping.
